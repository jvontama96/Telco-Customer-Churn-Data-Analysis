# Telecommunications Customer Churn Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of customer churn within a telecommunications company. The goal is to identify key factors that influence churn rates and to provide insights for potential churn mitigation strategies.

    - Churn Status Analysis
    - Senior Status with Dependents vs. No Dependents Churn Count Comparison

## Data Processing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, outliers, and data types.

## Statistical Summary
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Provided key statistical metrics (mean, median, etc.) for the dataset.

## Univariate Analysis
- **Contract Term Distribution**: Analyzed the distribution of contract terms among customers.
- **Total Charge Distribution**: Investigated the distribution of total charges to identify trends.

## Multivariate Analysis
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examined relationships between multiple variables, including demographic and usage data.
- **Feature Interaction**: Explored how different features interact with each other.

## Impact Analysis
- **Churn Status Analysis**: Investigated the distribution of customers based on their churn status.
- **Senior Status with Dependents vs. No Dependents Churn Count Comparison**: Compared churn rates between senior citizens with dependents and those without.
- **Average Spending of No Dependents in Each Churn Group**: Analyzed the average spending of customers with no dependents across different churn statuses.

## Conclusion
1. Overall, customers without dependents exhibit a higher churn count, irrespective of their senior citizen status. Specifically, customers without senior citizen status and no dependents represent the segment with the highest churn rate, reaching 1089 churned customers.
2. In the no dependents customer group, the number of non-churned customers is higher than that of churned customers, and the non-churned customers have a higher average TotalCharges. This indicates that churned customers in the no dependents group are not big spenders, as evidenced by their lower average total charges compared to non-churned customers.
